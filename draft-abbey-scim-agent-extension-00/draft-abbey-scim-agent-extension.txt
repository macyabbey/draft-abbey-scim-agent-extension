             SCIM Agents and Agentic Applications Extension
                draft-abbey-scim-agent-extension-latest

Abstract

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
   [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information
   about users and groups, as well as a protocol for communicating that
   information between systems.

   The systems that tend to implement SCIM clients and servers are
   identity providers, and service providers.  These are the same
   systems that are now need to manage agents and agentic applications
   across domains.

   This document describes a SCIM 2.0 extension for agents and agentic
   applications, which includes extensions to the core User and Group
   objects, and new resource types and schemas for agentic constructs.

   This extension is intended to provide greater interoperability
   between Identity providers, agentic applications, agents and their
   clients while reducing the responsibilities assumed by the every
   growing list of new protocols for agents.

1.  Introduction

   The SCIM protocol was originally developed to address an *abundance*
   of complex standards for describing and exchanging user information.

   As stated in the introduction of RFC7643#Section-1.1
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-1.1)

      While there are existing standards for describing and exchanging
      user information, many of these standards can be difficult to
      implement and/or use...

      This increases both the cost and complexity associated with
      organizations adopting products and services from multiple cloud
      providers, as they must perform redundant integration
      development...SCIM seeks to simplify this problem through an
      easily implemented specification suite...

   With the rise of AI, agents, and agentic applications, we see another
   abundance of protocols emerging, with varying levels of industry
   adoption, as well as implementation complexity as many brilliant and
   enthusiastic early adopters rush to define new standards for identity
   interopability.

   This includes but is not limited to:

   *  ACP (https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/core-concepts/agent-
      discovery)

   *  A2A (https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/agent-discovery/)

   *  ANS (https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agent-name-service-ans-for-
      secure-al-agent-discovery-v1-0/)

   *  AGNTCY (https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/overview/)

   The intent of this SCIM extension is to offer a viable path for the
   industry to re-leverage the well known core SCIM specifications, as
   well as existing implementations of SCIM clients and SCIM servers, to
   solve for agent cross domain management.

   In doing so, we can free the emerging standards in the agentic AI
   space to focus on truly novel concerns, instead of addressing the
   problems already solved by SCIM for user and groups.

   For example, in the A2A protocol, instead of describing a very high
   level concept of Curated registries (https://a2a-
   protocol.org/latest/topics/agent-discovery/#2-curated-registries-
   catalog-based-discovery) we could offer more concrete guidance by
   stating Agent Cards may be discovered by a SCIM client accessing any
   SCIM server that implements this extension.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definitions

   Agent: A workload with its own identifier, metadata and privileges
   which are independent of a particular runtime environment or
   containing application.  An agent is distinct from a traditional
   software workloads (lambdas, services, etc...) due to varying degrees
   of unpredictable behavior caused by delegation of control flow to
   artificial intelligence models.

   Agentic application: An application exposing one or more agents to
   its users.  An agentic application is similar to a traditional native
   or web application, in that there are pre-defined ways authenticate
   and interact with the application; however, as soon as the
   application exposes agents, there are additional considerations for
   managing access to that application.

4.  Core Schema Extensions

4.1.  ServiceProviderConfig

   SCIM endpoints that support Agent extensions MUST advertise this
   support in the ServiceProviderConfig endpoint as defined:

  agentExtension
     A complex type that specifies Agent Extension configuration options.

     supported Boolean value specifying whether any aspect of the extension is supported.

     agentsSupported Boolean value specifying whether the agent resource type
                     is supported

     agenticApplicationsSupported Boolean value specifying whether the agent
                                  resource type is supported

   This is required so that:

   1) Clients may know if the server supports the concept of Agents. 2)
   Servers discourage clients from confusing users and agents.

   If the server does not support the concept of agents, a SCIM client
   MAY choose to create a User representation in the server for an
   Agent.  All the reasons it may choose to do so are beyond the scope
   of this document.  If the client does so, the client SHOULD indicate
   the user is linked to an agent using a LinkedObject from draft-
   grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-
   grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01.txt) This would allow a SCIM server that
   supports that SCIM extension to add support for this extension and
   determine what users in the server should be mapped to agents when
   support is added.

5.  Additional ResourceTypes and Schemas

   This SCIM Agent extension defines additional ResourceTypes and
   Schemas that MAY be implemented by the service provider.  If
   implemented, these ResourceTypes SHOULD support all SCIM operations
   [RFC7644].  All attributes defined in the schemas are optional unless
   explicitly marked as REQUIRED.

5.1.  Agent

   This extension adds a new resource type of "Agent".

   Pursuant to [RFC7643] Section 3.2 Defining New Resource Types
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-3.2) this
   document define the ResourceType, Schema and Extensions for Agent.

5.1.1.  Agent Resource Type

   The Agent Resource Type schema is:

   {
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:ResourceType"],
      "id": "Agent",
      "name": "Agent",
      "endpoint": "/Agents",
      "description": "Agent identities",
      "schema": "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Agent"
   }

5.1.2.  Agent filtering

   Clients MAY have a reference to the Agent name or externalId but not
   the ID.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that service providers
   implement filtering that allows equality matching on the "name" and
   "externalId" attributes.

   Example (note that escaping has been removed for readability):

  GET /scim/v2/Agents?filter=name eq 'Helpdesk bot'

  GET /scim/v2/Agents?filter=externalId eq '8ccc535b-716d-4d32-b3e9-57c8be449c82'

5.1.3.  Agent Common Attributes

   The agent resource type contains the common SCIM resource type
   attributes defined in [RFC7643] Section 3.1 Common Attributes
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-3.1)

   They are listed here for completeness:

   *  id

   *  externalId

   *  meta

5.1.4.  Agent Core Schema

   The core agent schema provides the minimal representation of a
   resource "Agent".

   It contains only those attributes that any agent may need, and only
   one attribute is required.  It is identified using the schema URI:

   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Agent"

   The following attributes are defined in the core agent schema.

  name  The name of the Agent.  REQUIRED

  displayName
     The display name of the Agent.  If displayName is unassigned,
     the name MAY be used as the display name.

  active
     A Boolean value indicating the agent's administrative status.  The
     definitive meaning of this attribute is determined by the service
     provider.  As a typical example, a value of true implies that the
     agent is able to authenticate, while a value of false implies that the
     agent's account has been suspended and the agent will be unable to
     authenticate.

  description
     The description of the Agent.

  agentType
     The type of agent. There are no canonical values defined
     for type, but service providers MAY choose to define the valid
     types.

  active
     A Boolean value indicating the agent's administrative status.  The
     definitive meaning of this attribute is determined by the service
     provider.  As a typical example, a value of true implies that the
     agent is running, while a value of false implies that the
     agent has been suspended.

  entitlements
     An optional complex object that indicates entitlements the agent has.
     Its form is precisely the same as that defined in Section 4.1.2 of
     {{RFC7643}}.

  roles:
     An optional complex object that indicates roles the agent assumes.
     Its form is precisely the same as that defined in Section 4.1.2 of
     {{RFC7643}}.

  groups:
     An optional read-only complex object that indicates group
     membership.  Its form is precisely the same as that defined in
     Section 4.1.2 of {{RFC7643}}.

  applications
     A complex multi-valued attribute referencing applications this agent
     shares a trust boundary with. See "Agentic Application" section of
     this document.

  subject
     An optional attribute that clients may specify when
     provisioning an agent so that
     service providers implementing inbound token federation
     may correlate the agent with the `sub` claim in
     an inbound token from an OpenID connect provider.

 x509Certificates
     A list of certificates associated with the resource (e.g., a
     User).  Each value contains exactly one DER-encoded X.509
     certificate (see Section 4 of [RFC5280]), which MUST be base64
     encoded per Section 4 of [RFC4648].  A single value MUST NOT
     contain multiple certificates and so does not contain the encoding
     "SEQUENCE OF Certificate" in any guise.

  protocols
     A complex multi-value attribute that informs service providers of the
     various communication protocols an agent may support.
     This information can help service providers automatically
     support agent to agent or human to agent communication scenarios.
     An agent that supports no protocols is understood to the service provider
     to be inaccessible. For example, when an agent can only
     be accessed via its containing agentic application.

     The following sub-attributes are defined.

        type The type of the protocol. A number of canonical values
             are provided based on known agent protocols. They are:
             A2A, OpenAPI, MCP-Server

        specificationUrl The URL the service provider may retrieve the
                         specification document describing the agent's specific
                         information for that protocol.

  parent
     A complex attribute that defines the parent Agent of this
     Agent if the service provider supports hierarchies of
     agents.

     The following sub-attributes are defined.

        value  The ID of the agent that is the parent of this
           Agent in the hierarchy.

        $ref  A URI reference to the Agent that is the parent of this
           Agent in the hierarchy.

        display  The display name of the Agent that is the parent of
        this Agent in the hierarchy.

  owners
     A complex multi-valued attribute that defines the User or Group objects
     that are owners of this Agent.  OPTIONAL.  The following sub-attributes are
     defined for each value object.

     value  The ID of the User that owns this Agent.

     $ref  A URI reference to the User that owns this Agent.

     display  The display name of the user that owns this Agent.

5.1.4.1.  JSON Representation

5.1.4.1.1.  Minimal Agent Representation

   The following is a non-normative example of the minimal required SCIM
   representation in JSON format.

  {
     "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Agent"],

5.2.  Agentic application

   An Agentic application represents a software application that hosts
   or provides access to one or more agents.  It serves as a container
   and runtime environment for agents, managing their authentication,
   authorization, and access to resources.

5.2.1.  Resource Type

   The Agentic Application Resource Type schema is:

  {
     "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:ResourceType"],
     "id": "AgenticApplication",
     "name": "AgenticApplication",
     "endpoint": "/AgenticApplications",
     "description": "Applications that host or provide access to agents",
     "schema": "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:AgenticApplication",
  }

5.2.2.  Filtering

   Clients MAY have a reference to the Agentic Application name, URL, or
   externalId but not the ID.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that
   service providers implement filtering that allows equality matching
   on the "name", "externalId", and "applicationUrls.value" attributes.

   Example (note that escaping has been removed for readability):

  GET /scim/v2/AgenticApplications?filter=name eq 'AI Assistant Platform'

  GET /scim/v2/AgenticApplications?filter=externalId eq 'app-123456'

5.2.3.  Common attributes

   The agentic application resource type contains the common SCIM
   resource type attributes defined in [RFC7643] Section 3.1 Common
   Attributes (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-

5.2.4.  Schema

   The core agentic application schema provides the representation of an
   "AgenticApplication" resource.  It is identified using the schema
   URI:

   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:AgenticApplication"

   The following attributes are defined in the core agentic application
   schema.

  name
     The name of the Agentic Application. REQUIRED.

  displayName
     The display name of the Agentic Application. If displayName is unassigned,
     the name MAY be used as the display name.

  description
     The description of the Agentic Application.

  active
     A Boolean value indicating the application's administrative status.
     The definitive meaning of this attribute is determined by the service
     provider. As a typical example, a value of true implies that the
     application is operational, while a value of false implies that the
     application has been disabled.

  applicationUrls
     A complex multi-valued attribute containing URLs associated with the application.
     The following sub-attributes are defined:

     type
        The type of URL. Canonical values are: "ssoEndpoint", "loginPage", "api", "homepage".

     primary
        A Boolean value indicating whether this is the primary URL of this type.

     value
        The URL string value.

     description
        A human-readable description of the URL.

  lastAccessed
     Timestamp of when the application was last accessed by any agent or user.
     This attribute can be used for stale access detection and least privilege enforcement.

  oAuthConfiguration
     A complex multi-valued attribute that describes the OAuth connections of the application.
     The following sub-attributes are defined:

     clientId
        The OAuth client identifier as described in section 2.2 of RFC6749.

     description
        A human-readable description of the client ID.

     audienceUri
        The OAuth audience as defined
        in the "aud" claim of section 4.1.3 of RFC7519.

     issuerUri
        The identity provider issuer URI as defined in the "iss" claim
        of section 4.1.1 of RFC7519.

     redirectUri
        A multi-valued attribute containing authorized redirect URIs.


  agents
     A complex multi-valued attribute referencing agents associated with this application.
     The following sub-attributes are defined:

     value
        The ID of an agent associated with this application.

     ref
        A URI reference to an agent associated with this application.

     display
        The display name of the agent.

     type
        The relationship type between the agent and application.
        Canonical values are: "owned", "authorized", "guest".

  externalIdentifiers
     A complex multi-valued attribute containing identifiers associated with this application. OPTIONAL
     The following sub-attributes are defined:

     type
        The type of identifier. Service providers MAY define canonical values.
        <!-- Todo: what kind? I'm thinking about the SSO URLs of that application in the IDP -->

     value
        The identifier string value.

     system
        The system or domain this identifier is valid within.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   We would like to thanks the authors of the SCIM Extension for
   Privileged Access Management (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/
   draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01.txt) and Device Schema Extensions to
   the SCIM model (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scim-
   device-model/) which served as excellent guidance on how to document
   proposed extension to the SCIM protocol.

   Additionaly, we would like to thank all the contributors the emerging
   agent standards which inspired this extension, including:

   *  Agent communication protocol
      (https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/core-concepts/agent-
      discovery)

   *  Agent 2 Agent (https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/agent-
      discovery/)

   *  Agent name service (https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agent-name-
      service-ans-for-secure-al-agent-discovery-v1-0/)

   *  AGNTCY directory (https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/overview/)
